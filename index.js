/* 
  Add your pseudocode here


  1. iterate through array
      2. store current index 
      3. make numArray of other values (not current index)
      4. iterate through numArray
        5. store sum of current index and numArray index
        6. compare sum to target, if true return true
      7. reset numArray
    
  8. return false if sum === target was not true in loop.

/*
  Add written explanation of your solution here

  The key part is deciding how to keep track of your indices.
  You want to compare array[i] to array[everythingElse],
  with everythingElse being every other index.
  The best way to see that, for me, is by creating a new array that doesn't 
  contain the current index value, hence using splice.
  However, because splice is destructive, I have to reset it every time
  we iterate through the loop.
